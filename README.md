# Cplusplus-Program

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was an assignment that for a zoo to maintain, create, and view animal records.  This project kept track of many different aspects of the animals, including:  tracking number, name, type, sub-type, and number of eggs or nursing.  Data is loaded from a text file, and can be manipulated such as adding records, saving, generate data, and display data.

#What did you do particularly well?
I did a nice job on this assignment adding classes and attributes.  In addition, I utilized inheritance, and created a vector.  I was also 
happy about the flow and how cleaned up the code was.  This implemented coding best practices.  

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I was very happy with my code for this project, but there is always room for improvement.  I am sure I could have made the code more efficient so the program could run smoother.  

#Did you find writing any piece of this code ot be challenging and how did you overcome this?  What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found it a bit difficult to keep up with all of the different classes in this project since there were so many.  Also, I found it 
difficult to implement java and C++.  I overcame this challenge of implementing java by using eclipse first to make sure the C++ code itself
was functional first (by commenting out the java code), then implementing this code witht he java code into eclipse (which is not as 
user friendly, but had the environment set up for C++ and Java).  This helped me get the project completed.  I also used Stack Overflow to 
help read up on different topics when I was stuck on something.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?  
The skill of C++ coding and best practices is defintely a skill that is transferable to other projects and courses.  In addition,
being familiar with different IDE's is an important skill to have in the future as well.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable be including comments throughout the main code so it can be understood by others in the future what the main idea is for each section of code.  I tried using readable formatting also so it was easy to read.
